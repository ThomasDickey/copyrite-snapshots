<  * Created:	06 Jan 1992
<  *
<  * Function:	masks all non-comment characters to non-ascii (except for
<  *		whitespace contiguous in the same line).  Doing this makes
<  *		it simpler to compare comment blocks containing copyrite notice
<  *		as well as to remove comments.
<  *
<  * Bugs:	except for "c", this does not know about inline comments.
